# Watch face generation

Some details about how this module is used for watch face generation.

## Modifying the watch face

The `assets` directory holds the necessary Watch Face Format resources, namely AndroidManifest.xml,
watchface.xml, watch_face_info.xml and so on. These files are exactly as output by a tool such as
the Figma plugin, Watch Face Designer.

In order to modify these to show the Androidify bot, adjust an `<Image>` tag to point to the "bot"
resource, e.g. `<Image resource="bot"/>`: In compiling the APK, the `bot.png` file will be added, so
this resource will be available to the watch face.

You should ensure that any unnecessary images are removed from `res/drawable`, for example if Watch
Face Designer outputted a placeholder image that you are replacing for `bot.png`, remove the
placeholder image (it's likely large!). Furthermore, ensure that the images are optimized, for
example, using `pngquant` on all images, to help keep the watch face size to a minimum.

## Packaging the watch face

To package the watch face, the [Pack](https://github.com/google/pack) is used. This is a native
library, so the pre-builts are provided in `jniLibs`. A script is also included for building these
fresh, but that should not be necessary.
